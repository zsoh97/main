== Introduction

Volant is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing people they meet during their solo travels*. More importantly, Volant is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
