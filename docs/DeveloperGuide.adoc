== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

* <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` is used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file, `volant.log`.

The rest of the App consists of four main components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor depending on the view the user is on.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory depending in the view the user is on.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its
API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Views in Volant

There are 4 types of pages/views in this App: `HOME`, `TRIP`, `ITINERARY`, `JOURNAL`.
Each view has their own `{Component Name} Manager` classes for both `Logic` and `Model`.

These individual `{Component Name} Manager` classes for `Logic` and `Model` provide a context for commands to be executed in,
e.g. when the user is on the `HOME` page, the `add` command modifies the trip list, when the user
is on the `ITINERARY` page, the `add` command modifies the itinerary.

For example, the `JOURNAL` view has its own `JournalLogicManager` and `JournalModelManager` to provide the context
for command execution on the `JOURNAL` page.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `back` when in a `TRIP` view. View switching is executed by the `Ui` component.

.Component interactions for `back` command in the `TRIP` view.
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]


The _Sequence Diagram_ below illustrates how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `goto 1` when in a `HomePage` view.
View switching is executed by the `Ui` component.

.Component interactions for `goto 1` command in the `HomePage` view.

image::gotoCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details about each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component when a user is on a `TRIP` page
image::UIClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StatusBarFooter`, `mainPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== View Switching
As there are four different views in Volant. Upon startup of the App, the `mainPanel` is set to `HomePage`.
There are certain commands will cause the `MainWindow` display to switch views.
For example, `goto`, `back` and `home` navigation commands.

When a view is switched, `MainWindow` will do the following:

====
For example, if a user is switching from a `TRIP` view to the `HOME` view through the command, `back`.

. Reassign the `Logic` component from `TripPageLogicManager` to a new `HomePageLogicManager`.
. Reassign the `Model` component from `TripPageModelManager` to a new `HomePageModelManager`.
. Reassign the value of `StackPane` `mainPanel` from `TripPage` to `HomePage`.

_More details on the implementation of view switching can be found in <<implementation-view-switching>>._

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram1]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::JournalLogicDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `JournalInputParser` class of the current feature to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `JournalLogicManager` of the current feature.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` of the current feature (e.g. adding a trip).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component of the Itinerary feature for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component in Journal
image::JournalModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` for `JOURNAL`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores an `Entry` 's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Entry>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

.Structure of the Model Component in Itinerary
image::ItineraryModel.png[]

The `Model` for `ITINERARY`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores an `Activity` 's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Activity>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/location/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `XYZList` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.volant.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[implementation-view-switching]]
=== View Switching for Navigation Commands
The entire process of view switching is done in the `MainWindow` class.

[TIP]
====
*List of Navigation Commands*

* `goto` on the `HOME` page
* `goto` on the `TRIP` page
* `back`
* `home`
====

==== Implementation
Each `CommandResult` from an execution in the `MainWindow` class stores data on
*if a command is a navigation command or not.* If the command is a navigation command, the `MainWindow` will execute the
appropriate functions to facilitate view switching.


==== Special Cases
When `back` command is used in the <<root-page>>, this would not have any effect on the current GUI being
displayed.

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current location book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous location book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone location book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial location book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single location book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th trip in the location book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the location book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted location book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new trip. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified location book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the location book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the trip was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous location book state, and restores the location book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial location book state, then there are no previous location book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the location book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest location book state, then there are no undone location book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the location book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all location book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire location book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the trip being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of location book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
